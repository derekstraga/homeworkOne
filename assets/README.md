# Homework 3.7.2020
In this homework we were asked to clean up a web page in html and it's accompanying style sheet. 


# Additions/Improvements
In the assignment I found multiple small adjustments that should be made. The first prompt told us we needed semantics. Therefore, I added header and footer attributes as well as used sections in some areas instead of divs.
I reorganized some lines so that it was more organized and had an overall more orderly design. 
I then added alt attributes to all of the pictures.
I then changed some of the heading attributes so that they fell in sequential order from largest to smallest.
I changed the title of the web page to something clear and consise that sums up the information presented. 

## Thoughts 
I thought this was a great exercise to ease into the practice of correcting code and making it more accessible to everyone. The exercise wasn't too hard or overwhelming at all.
